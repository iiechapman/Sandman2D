SDLEngine

Welcome to the main page for the Sandman 2D Game Engine.

The Sandman engine is my first fully extensible, scriptable , platform independent 2D game engine. Once the core elements of the engine are complete, I will be implementing a 3D version of the engine as well.

As it stands ,the engine is currently scripted through XML libraries. It handles Tiled TMX map files as its map format. It also handles PNG for textures for sprites, WAV's and OGG's for sound effects and music.

The engine is currently in alpha development stage. When version 1 is released it will have all the core components available.

The goal of the engine is to be a platform independent,highly optimized, intuitive, user friendly, rapid iteration tool for making games that requires very little understanding of how the engine works behind the scenes. 

The first version of the engine will feature keyboard and controller input to control the game, event and process handling to define game logic, 2d texture rendering to display the game, a simple to use audio manager to play sound effects and music, real time lighting, physics simulation, particle systems, and basic AI systems to add life to games made with the engine.

Features slated for future release are:
1.Lua Scripting for robust game logic
2.Pre-defined gaming elements such as platformer movement, top down game movement, point and click movement for easy plug n' play prototyping.
3.Live Editing tools such as Live Map editing, Live Variable editing, Live AI tweaking
4.Console to tweak any aspect of the game, debug and prototype 
5.3D Rendering to handle 3D scenes
